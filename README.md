# Static Comp Challenge  

## Background  
The static Comp Challenge is an individual project assigned in week 3 of Mod 1 at Turing.

## Overview  
For this project I had to recreate a webpage based off a provided static comp. While I had some creative freedom, the main objective was to maintain the integrity of the original design.
